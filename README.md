# TinDog

## Description
"TinDog" is a project I developed while participating in the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program. It's a fun web application where users can swipe to like or pass on photos of dogs. This project emphasizes the use of advanced JavaScript concepts, with a focus on ES6 classes and the modularization of code into multiple JavaScript files for simplicity and readability.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)

## Learnings
- Applied JavaScript classes to encapsulate the functionality of the app.
- Organized code by splitting it into several modules for clarity and separation of concerns.
- Demonstrated the use of module import and export statements to connect different parts of the JavaScript codebase.
